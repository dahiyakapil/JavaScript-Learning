/*
    Can you name one method that automatically converts a value to a string?
   
    The toString() method in JavaScript is commonly used to automatically convert a value to a string representation. This method can be called on various data types such as numbers, booleans, and objects to obtain a string representation of their values.

let num = 123;
let str = num.toString(); // num is explicitly converted to a string using toString() method.
console.log(str);      
console.log(typeof str);
