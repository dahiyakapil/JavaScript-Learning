/*
    What are the syntax rules of JSON


    1. Data is in name/value pairs: Each piece of data is represented as a key/value pair (key: value).
    2. Keys must be strings: Keys must always be enclosed in double quotes (").
    3. Values can be various data types: Values can be:
    .Strings (in double quotes)
        Numbers
        Objects (in curly braces {})
        Arrays (in square brackets [])
        Booleans (true or false)
        null
    4.Objects are enclosed in curly braces {}: An object begins and ends with curly braces.
    5.Arrays are enclosed in square brackets []: An array begins and ends with square brackets.
    6. Data is separated by commas: Each key/value pair in an object or element in an array is separated by a comma.
    6. No trailing commas: No comma should appear after the last key/value pair in an object or array.
    8.Strings must be enclosed in double quotes: String values must be enclosed in double quotes ("), not single quotes.
    9.No functions or methods: JSON cannot contain functions or methods.
    10.No comments allowed: JSON does not support comments.
