    What is the purpose of dir method of console object

    The console.dir() method is used to display an interactive list of the properties of a specified JavaScript object. Unlike console.log(), which outputs the object in a more generic way, console.dir() provides a more detailed and interactive representation of the object, especially useful for inspecting objects with a deep or complex structure.
