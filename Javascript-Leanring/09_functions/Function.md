# Function

## 1. Function Statement or Function Declaration
    Function Statement or function declaration is just a normal function in which just give a naming convention to the function. With the help of this function statement we can perform hoisting. It means we can call the function without it's declaration

    abc() // hoisting to the top before declaration

    function abc () {
        console.log("This is function statement or function declaration");
    }
