Que 1. What are closures?

A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its parent's lexical environment.
In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function’s scope from an inner function.

Que 2. How you’ll explain more about it?

Each and every function in JS have access to it’s outer lexical environment that means it has access to variables and functions which are present in environment of it’s parent lexical environment.
Even If the function is executed in some other scope instead of original(local) scope, it will still remember it’s outer lexical environment where it was originally present in the code.
