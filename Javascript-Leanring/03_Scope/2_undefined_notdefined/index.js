/*
    1. Undefined is a Special Placeholder which is used to reserve memory for the variables in the memory creation phase. Even before a single line of code is executed, JS engine assigns undefined to the variables.

    2. Not Defined means if we try to console or access any variable which is not declared in the code then we get Not Defined error.

    3. JS is a loosely typed language or weakly typed language means it does not attaches its variables to specific data types like in C++ and java.

    4.  Remember undefined !== not defined.
