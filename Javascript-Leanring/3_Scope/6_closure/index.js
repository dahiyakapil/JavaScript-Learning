    A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer functionâ€™s scope from an inner function

    Closure is when a function is able to remember and access its lexical scope even when that function is executing outside its lexical scope.

  }
